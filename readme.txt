Homework 3 - MIPS Recursion Program
Written By: B04902077 Wei-Hsuan Chiang

1. About the Implementation
    This homework is mostly based on my hw2 work. Only the recursion function is the extra work in this homework.
    In each recursion iteration, the stack will need 2 extra word to save the passing argument and the return address, so the stack has to be grown 8 bytes per iteration. Next, after some calculation and recursive function calling, the result can be successfully calculated and outputted.
    By the way, this recursion function seems to have a simple mathematical formula, so implementing a recursive solution might be an overkill to this function.

2. About the Platform: Apple MacBook Pro with OS Sierra 10.12.6
